# markdown-webpage-generator

I want an app that creates a markdown version of a web page when a user enters URL in a form on the app and clicks submit. Once the markdown is generated, below the form show a screenshot of the page on the left hand side and the markdown text on the right hand side. Make it responsive so, on smaller screens the screenshot is above the markdown text.
